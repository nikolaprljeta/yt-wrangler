## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Ensure **ffmpeg** and **yt-dlp** are installed, or let the script install/update them.
3. Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikolaprljeta/yt-wrangler.git
cd yt-wrangler
```

4. Make the script executable (Unix systems):

```bash
chmod +x yt-wrangler.sh
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
./yt-wrangler.sh
```

Choose an option:

- **Paste text manually** ‚Äì Enter any text (emails, messages, articles, etc.) and the script will automatically extract YouTube URLs from the mixed content
- **Use text from urls.txt** ‚Äì Load any text file containing YouTube links mixed with other content
- **Quit** ‚Äì Exit the script

After choosing an option, you will see a list of extracted URLs with video titles. Confirm which videos to download. Progress and errors are logged in `download.log`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration / Examples

- **Text input** can include any kind of mixed content - emails, chat logs, articles, documents - the script intelligently extracts only YouTube URLs
- **`urls.txt`** can contain mixed text content or clean URLs. YouTube links will be extracted automatically. Already-downloaded URLs will be commented out automatically
- **Disk space warning** triggers if less than 2 GB is free
- **Downloads are resumable**; failed or timed-out downloads remain in `urls.txt` for retrying
